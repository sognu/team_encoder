  * rle.{c,h}        	- RLE source code
  * huff_io, io.{c,h}	- I/O
  * huff_tree, tree.{c,h}   - Huffman tree

* Description:
  * This was a project implemented in teams.  I wrote 'rle.c' while other team members wrote the rest.  I only posted the file I wrote to respect other team member's privacy.
